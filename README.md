Welcome to my first ever large project, Valley of Trials! I started this project with an aim to educate new prospective World of Warcraft players on the basics of the game and what to think about when creating their first character. I also wanted to try and instil some sense of wonder about the game, something that most of the playerbase has felt at one time or another.

This was my first ever project. I used it as a playground for applying the stuff I had been learning from online resources and Mozilla's course on web development. Valley of Trials sought in some way to alleviate any uncertainties about starting a game as complicated as World of Warcraft is. It's obviously unfinished, but I learned a lot to get the project to its current state. I made Valley of Trials before I had any idea how to use Git and GitHub, or even before I had much JavaScript knowledge.

Within this project, I learned how to (amongst other things):

- Do the information architecture
- Use HTML, CSS and JS in tandem with each other 
- Use comments effectively

(HTML)

- Give the HTML structure
- Link to favicons inside the <head>
- Create social media <meta> tags
- Structure a navbar with dropdown menus
- Add attributes to HTML elements which aid accessibility
- Write HTML which CSS and JS can rely on

(CSS)

- Design the website responsively via a mobile-first approach and media queries
- Use CSS layout to my advantage
- Use the transform and transition properties to create cool effects
- How to hide content from display to later show using JS
- Write CSS that JS can rely on

(JS)

- Slide in the nav options menu in mobile and tablet mode
- Prevent the default behaviour of anchor elements with links inside
- Use JS to manipulate the DOM and CSS
- Create a scroll-to-top button
- Use matchMedia to add another layer of responsive-ness 

Perhaps one day when there is more depth to my web development skills I shall come back and finish it, but for now I have moved onto other things.
