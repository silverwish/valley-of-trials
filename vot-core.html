                    <p>This section introduces you to the first core elements of World of Warcraft you'll need to understand when creating your first character: which role to fulfil, choosing between Alliance and Horde, and picking a race on your chosen faction. Evaluating which role suits you best is a little more complex than you might first imagine, so the Roles section breaks down the ways in which each role is fulfilled, and provides an insight into the responsibilities you would be expected to deliver as a player within that role.</p>
                    
                    <p>Following the Roles page is an exploration of each of the factions and their playable races. The role you fulfil will comprise a part of what your character feels like to play, and the faction you choose is a matter of cosmetic preference. Finally, the race (specific to your chosen faction) you select forms the basis of what your character looks like. Your choice of race could have a minor effect on the performance of your character, but generally speaking the first main characters players create tend to be a result of cosmetic preference, and to some extent, are an expression of some aspect of the player's own real-life characteristics.</p>
